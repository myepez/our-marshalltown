# The Motivation To Create The Map
This project was inspired, in part, by the work of Strong Towns, whose thoughtful approach to local development and land use prompted me to look at Marshalltown through a new lens. Their emphasis on understanding the financial productivity of places encouraged me to ask a simple question: Are we investing public dollars in a way that reflects where our city’s value is actually being generated?

To help answer that, I created a 3D visualization of property tax contributions across Marshalltown. This tool doesn’t just show how much different parts of town contribute—it invites a conversation about how those contributions could guide more equitable and effective city investments.

# How Was The Map Created
The map was created with the help of Marshall County staff. They provided 2023 Marshalltown property tax data that is avaiable to the public and their relationshsips with parcel IDs. The data was cleaned and mapped using Python programming libraries like PyDeck and Panda.


# What the Map Reveals
By visualizing parcel-level tax data in three dimensions, patterns emerge that are difficult to see in spreadsheets or flat maps. Some of the highest-performing areas in terms of revenue per acre are dense, mixed-use zones, or legacy neighborhood places that often go underappreciated in city budgeting. On the flip side, larger parcels with lower density sometimes contribute less tax per acre despite requiring more infrastructure to serve them.

This isn’t about fault or favoritism —- it’s about understanding the return on public investment and making sure we’re taking care of the places that are sustaining the city financially.

# What's Next
The idea behind this project was sparked by Strong Towns—whose writing got me thinking more critically about the relationship between land use and public finance. But the application here is fully local, focused on Marshalltown’s unique needs and opportunities. My hope is that this tool helps us make more thoughtful, data-informed decisions about where we build, fix, and invest next.
